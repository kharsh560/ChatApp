Re-creating the entire project!! 

1) This time, it is in NEXT.js and backend in MEN.
2) Will be using next-auth for user authentication with gmail integration (using O-Auth) and phone number verification too.
3) The Next codes will be in TS.
4) Web-sockets for realtime messaging, ofcourse.
5) Also, I'm thinking of making video/audio call feature using web-RTC.

Be patient for this project.
