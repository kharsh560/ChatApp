Just so that this project was in working condition. Here's the working video of it. It's dated 2nd March 2024!

By the way guys, I'm re-creating the entire project!! 

1) This time, it is in NEXT.js and backend in MEN(MongoDB, Express, and Node) or, I might use Prisma too, let's see!
2) Next-auth will be used for user authentication with Gmail integration (using OAuth) and phone number verification is also in my bucket list.
3) The Next codes will be in TS, of course.
4) Web-sockets for realtime messaging, of course.
5) I'm also considering making a video/audio call feature using WebRTC. Wish me luck!

I'd appreciate it if you could be patient for this project.
